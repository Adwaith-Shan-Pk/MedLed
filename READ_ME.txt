Blockchain for Medicine Authenticity
📌 Overview

Counterfeit and substandard medicines are one of the biggest threats to global healthcare, affecting millions of patients every year. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure that every medicine—from manufacturer to patient—is authentic, traceable, and tamper-proof.

By assigning each medicine batch a unique digital identity stored on a blockchain, patients, pharmacies, and regulators can verify authenticity instantly using simple tools like QR codes or RFID scans.

🎯 Objectives

Prevent counterfeit and fake drugs from entering the supply chain.

Provide end-to-end transparency in the pharmaceutical distribution network.

Enable patients, pharmacies, and regulators to easily verify medicine authenticity.

Build trust in healthcare systems through immutable, decentralized records.

⚙️ How It Works

Manufacturing Stage

Each medicine batch is assigned a unique digital token (QR / RFID / NFC).

Manufacturing details (date, factory ID, composition, batch ID) are recorded on the blockchain.

Distribution Stage

Each transfer of medicine (manufacturer → distributor → wholesaler → pharmacy) is logged as a blockchain transaction.

Records are immutable and auditable.

Patient Stage

Patients scan the medicine’s code via a mobile app/web portal.

The system instantly verifies authenticity, expiry date, and supply chain history.

💡 Possible Applications
1. Pharmaceutical Industry

Track medicines from factory to patient.

Prevent counterfeit and expired drugs.

Ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., US FDA DSCSA, EU FMD).

2. Hospitals & Pharmacies

Verify authenticity of purchased drugs before dispensing.

Maintain inventory transparency.

Reduce risks of medical fraud.

3. Government & Regulators

Real-time monitoring of drug supply chains.

Rapid detection of counterfeit batches.

Build national/regional medicine authenticity registries.

4. Patients

Verify medicine before consumption.

Ensure correct dosage, expiry, and source.

Build trust in healthcare systems.

5. Global Health Initiatives

Combat counterfeit medicines in developing countries.

Strengthen supply chain resilience during pandemics (e.g., vaccine authenticity).

Integrate with NGOs for medical relief operations.
